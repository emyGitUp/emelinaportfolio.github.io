            Hello! I am Emelina Hendrickson, also known as Emy. I love designing characters, illustrating stories, and developing creative projects! When I’m not working, I enjoy producing my own comics and petting my guinea pigs.<br>
            Although my work mostly contains cartoons, I have a wide range of styles. Learning new techniques from collaborating with clients is why I'm passionate about design. I'm always eager to expand my set of skills and put them to good use. 

            Help me help you!<br>
